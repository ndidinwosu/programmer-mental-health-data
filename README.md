# Programmer Mental Health Data Analysis Project

This was my final project for my Data Visualization course, DSCI 304, taken in Spring of 2023. The final presentation can be found here: https://sites.google.com/rice.edu/programmers-ok/home?authuser=1 

The data was obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-2016), from the Open Sourcing Mental Health (https://osmhhelp.org/research.html). The mental health survey was distributed and collexted in 2016.
